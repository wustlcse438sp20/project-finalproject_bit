App Name: 
    Blog Sharing Social App

Description: 
    We made a blog social app. In this app, every user will have a separate account. Users can post blog,
and the content can be pictures and text. After a blog post by the user, we will use the GPS function to 
display the address.  Besides, other users can also comment blog, and can give the blog a red heart to show
that they like it. We also allow users to modify personal information such as nickname and profile picture.
We also add a social system to this app. For example, a user can add others as friends and chat privately 
with them. We also have short video sharing function, which will allow users to upload short videos shot 
by the camera or from local album to the blog.
